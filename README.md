# Travel Art

This is another app in my Travel Games series built with the Google Maps API. Enter your starting point and draw directly on the map. Your drawing will snap to roadways and a (very random) travel itenrary will appear below. Happy experimenting!

You can view a demo of the project [here](https://jordan-castelloe.github.io/travel-art/).
